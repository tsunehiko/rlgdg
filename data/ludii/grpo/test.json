To play the game well requires counting ahead as pawns race each other.\n</description>\n<rules>\nEach side has a line of pawns. The pawns move as in chess i.e. The pawn moves forwards one square (optionally two squares on its first move) and captures diagonally forwards one square by replacing the opponent\u2019s piece. The rule of En Passant is also allowed. White goes first. The first person to reach the other side is the winner. You also win if it is your opponent\u2019s move and they have no moves left. In Ludii, options are also available to add each of the five other Chess piece types.
